   <p>This was a challenging couple of assignments, but I was really excited to take on the challenge of creating a website from scratch. I remember being really proud of myself for being 
      able to put a picture of my dog on my website and sending the website link to my family. The first assignment  was able to get my feet underneath me and learn the basics. 
      The second HTML assignment required more content, which was difficult, but still exposed me to new ways of coding which was valuable. Then came the CSS assignment which  helped me with the design 
      aspect of website building because it was really hard for me as someone who loves designing and creating to not to be able to format and design things in an easy way since HTML is such a simple language.
      With CSS, I was able to properly format things and actually design a visually interesting webpage. But those were the easy parts. I got really frustrated with combined declaration syntax. 
      Logically, it makes sense to me, but I couldn't seem to put it into practice. Looking back, I think I tried to jam too many elements into one page which didn't help me either. 
      Overall, the HTML and CSS assignments helped me develop my coding skills and now that I have some experience, I feel more comfortable with the HTML and CSS languages and I think that 
      will be valuable down the road.   </p>

    <p>The portfolio assignment was much easier because I believe that I am a visual design person, so this was up my alley more than coding. I wish I could've figured out how to have my documents actually
        preview instead of showing that view button that you see under the business case. It's more visually interesting to see the documents rather than having to go through the links and buttons. 
        People want to see things immediately and don't want to have to be taken to a new tab to see documents. Next time, I think I would spend more time insuring that the color palette was a little 
        more consistent and cohesive. I like the pink sky in the sunset picture on the homepage because it contrasts the blues, but looking back, I don't like the pink of the buttons because it doesn't
        fit with the pink of the sunset. I could've picked a better color grey for the background, and could've used a different color blue that matched the blue tones of the picture on the about me page.
        I think I got caught up in figuring out what work samples to put together because I haven't had to put together a portfolio of my coursework yet. Overall, I enjoyed this assignment because I was 
        able to focus on the visual aspects versus the behind-the-scenes coding part, but there's things that I would change looking at it now.   </p>

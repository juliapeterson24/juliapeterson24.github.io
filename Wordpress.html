    <p>The portfolio assignment was much easier because I believe that I am a visual design person, so this was up my alley a lot more than coding. I wish I could've figured out how to have my documents actually
        preview instead of showing that view button that you see under the business case. I think it would've been more visually interesting than the links and buttons. People want to see things immediately
        and don't want to have to be taken to a new tab to see documents. Next time, I think I would spend more time insuring that the color palette was a little more consistent. I like the pink sky in the sunset 
        picture bring some contrast from all the blues, but looking back, I don't like the pink in the buttons, I could've picked a better color grey for the background, and could've used a different color blue 
        that matched the blue tones of the picture on the about me page. Overall, I enjoyed this assignment because I was able to focus on the visual aspects versus the behind-the-scenes coding part, but 
        there's things that I would change looking at it now.   </p>

    <p>The most challenging part of this assignment was coming up with a business idea. It felt a little too real to me to make a website for a made up company because this is an area of marketing that I could see
       myself in. Maybe not in the next several years, but I may just have to keep J Media in my back pocket. Squarespace was super sophisticated and made it really easy to make a visually pleasing website. 
      I did feel like there were some restrictions with the software that made it difficult to work with, but I liked this platform the best. My website looks very professional in a way that my other websites may
      not. This assignment also felt like it had really specific and clear parameters which made it easier to work with versus something like creating a portfolio, I get in my head about what to include which takes
      away time and energy from other aspects of the project.   </p>

    <p>The most challenging part of this assignment was coming up with a business idea. It felt a little too real to me to make a website for a madeup company because this is an area of marketing that I could see
      myself in. Maybe not in the next couple years, but I may just have to keep J Media in my back pocket for a later date. Squarespace is super sophisticated and made it really easy to make a visually pleasing website. 
      I did feel like there were some restrictions with the software/templates that made it difficult to work with, but I liked this web design platform the best. I believe this  website looks very professional 
      in a way that my other websites may not. This assignment had specific and clear parameters which made it easier to work with versus something like creating a portfolio is hard because I'm so invested 
      in it and I get in my head about what to include which takes away time and energy from other aspects of the project. With this assignment, everything was made up so I really got to run with an idea
      without having to justify why I included certain things like you would in a portfolio. If I had to make a website of my own in the future, I would consider purchasing a Squarespace domain because it's 
      ease of use and the professional look.  </p>

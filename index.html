<h1>Henry and Milo's Playdate</h1>

<p><h3> Milo and Henry are brothers from another mother, <i>literally</i>. Both Lhasa Apso/Maltese's, this page is dedicated to their August playdate. </h3> </p>

<p> Milo is 13 and is owned by our old neighbors. My family loved Milo <b>so</b> much, we decided to get our own! Henry will be 9 in mid September.</p>

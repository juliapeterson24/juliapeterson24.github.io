<div class="header"> Welcome to my website! </div>

<p> I have learned so much throughout this semester. I had a very limited understanding of HTML and CSS thanks to the few classes of web design I took in junior high before dropping that class for scheduling reasons. 
   I've always looked back at that class and wished I had been able to take that class, so when I had to take this class for my digital media certificate, I was excited. It has 
   been a challenge at times, especially with the HTML and CSS side of things. Wordpress and Squarespace were easier for me to work with because I've had some experience with 
   that sort of web design. I'm glad I was able to work on my coding skills because I think that is a valuable skill to have especially going into the creative marketing field.</p>

<p> For this final project, I wanted to create a website I could be proud of, one that I really put a lot of effort into. This meant challenging myself beyond what I've learned in class and add elements
   that we didn't go over, like the snazzy navigation bar you'll use shortly.S Something I've realized more and more throughout the semester is  a lot of these webpage
   functions have already been coded and are on the internet for me to copy and modify based on my needs. This really helped me get out the box that I was in where I thought I had to code everything from scratch. 
   So even though I am reflecting on each of the assignments I've completed throughout the semester, this is also a new assignment where I learned new skills along the way. 
   I hope you enjoy looking through my work! </p>

Here's a list of things Henry loves!

   <li>His toys</li>
   <li>Fish</li>
   <li>Vanilla ice cream</li>
   <li>Walks around the block</li>
</ul>

<p>As I reflect on the last 9ish years with Henry, here's some of my favorite memories with him.</p>
<ol>
   <li>Going to the breeder to pick him up as a puppy</li>
   <li>His playdates with Milo</li>
   <li>Chasing after a squirrel, tearing his ACL and needing surgery</li>
   <li>Any time he jumps on my bed and lays with me</li>
</ol>

<p>I miss Henry very much. If you find him as cute as I do, you can follow him on Instagram! <link><a href="https://instagram.com/henrybeanpete">@henrybeanpete</a><link></p>
